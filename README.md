# Titanic
Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction
This Python script, created in Spyder, focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The script includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model training and evaluation.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib

Instructions
Run the Script:
Execute the script in a Python environment.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads Titanic passenger data from the 'Titanic_Passengers.csv' file.
Cleans the data, handling missing values and incorrect entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Displays the first few rows of the dataframe.
Prints column names and unique values for each column.
Visualizes data using pie charts, bar charts, histograms, and subplots.
Machine Learning Model:

Replaces missing values in the 'Age' column with the median.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Prepares data for the KNN model by selecting features and encoding categorical variables.
K-Nearest Neighbors Model:

Creates and trains the KNN model with 5 neighbors.
Makes predictions and evaluates the model's accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

Prints model predictions and the accuracy score.

Note: This project uses a placeholder data file named 'Titanic_Passengers.csv.' Ensure you replace it with your own dataset if needed.
